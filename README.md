## What is Awal Terminal?

A native macOS terminal built from scratch with Swift and Rust, designed specifically for working with AI coding agents like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| GPU-Accelerated Rendering | Metal-powered rendering at 120fps with a glyph atlas and triple buffering. 10,000-line scrollback buffer |
| LLM Profiles | Switch between Claude, Gemini, Codex, or plain shell in one click. Save per-model configurations |
| AI Side Panel | Track token usage, costs, context window, file references, and git changes in real time |
| Smart Output Folding | AI tool calls, code blocks, and diffs auto-collapse into foldable regions. Click to expand |
| Screenshot to Session | Press `Cmd+Shift+S` or click the camera icon to capture a screen region and paste its file path into the terminal. Perfect for sharing screenshots with AI agents |
| Voice Input | Push-to-talk voice input powered by on-device speech recognition |
| AI Components | Auto-detect your project stack and inject skills, rules, prompts, agents, MCP servers, and hooks into AI sessions from shared registries. Supports git, [localskills](https://localskills.dev), and local directory sources. Visual mapping editor for non-standard registry structures. Per-component enable/disable, security scanning with rules toggle, hook approval gate with audit trail, and import/export |
| Sub-Stack Detection | Automatically detects frameworks like Next.js, Django, Flask, Vapor, NestJS, and more on top of base stack detection for more targeted component injection |
| Resume Sessions | Browse and resume past AI sessions from the startup menu. Claude sessions show turn count and time ago; Codex and Gemini launch their built-in session pickers |
| Plan-Aware Tab Naming | Automatically detects AI plan headers and offers to rename the tab to match the plan title |
| Smart Notifications | Desktop alerts when long-running AI tasks complete |
| Tabs & Windows | Multiple windows (`Cmd+N`), native tabs with drag-to-reorder, tab tearoff to new window, custom tab colors, per-tab titles, tab groups with collapse/expand, and vertical sidebar tab bar |
| Quick Terminal | Quake-style dropdown terminal with a global hotkey (`Ctrl+``) |
| Find in Terminal | Search through scrollback with match highlighting and keyboard navigation. OSC 8 hyperlinks and drag-and-drop file pasting |
| Syntax Highlighting | Language-aware coloring for code blocks and diffs inside AI output |
| Git Integration | Live branch, status, and changed files displayed in the status bar and side panel. Click any changed file to view its diff inline. Per-tab worktree isolation for parallel workstreams |
| Large Paste Protection | Confirmation dialog for large pastes with options to save to file, truncate, or paste all. Configurable threshold |
| Mission Control | Dashboard window (`Cmd+Shift+D`) showing all active AI agents across tabs and windows with real-time status, total cost, tokens, elapsed time, and per-agent kill switches |
| Session Recording | Record AI coding sessions (`Cmd+Option+Shift+R` to start/stop) and export as GIF. Idle time compression for compact output |
| Per-Tab Token Tracking | Each tab independently tracks its own token usage and cost, visible in the AI side panel and Mission Control |
| Danger Mode | Skip all AI tool confirmation prompts for unrestricted sessions. Toggle from the View menu; always resets on app launch |
| Automatic Updates | Checks GitHub Releases for new versions and shows an indicator in the status bar. Supports Homebrew and direct download updates |
| Command Palette | Quick-access to all actions via `Cmd+Shift+P` with fuzzy search |
| Copy as Markdown | Right-click or `Cmd+Shift+C` to copy terminal output with code fences, blockquotes, and formatting preserved |
| Smart Autocomplete | File path and command history completions as you type |
| Remote Control | Detect Claude Code's remote control mode, show a REMOTE badge in the status bar, and display a QR code popover to connect from your phone. Enable from the View menu |
| Prevent Sleep | Prevent macOS from sleeping during active terminal sessions. Auto-activates during remote control sessions |
| Stealth Mode | Full-screen black overlay that hides all terminal content while your session continues safely in the background. Press any key to return |
| Fully Configurable | Theme colors, fonts, keybindings, and voice settings in a single config file |

## Getting Started

### Install with Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap AwalTerminal/tap
brew install --cask awal-terminal
```

No quarantine workarounds needed — Homebrew handles it automatically.

### Download manually

Grab the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AwalTerminal/awal-terminal/releases/latest).

Since the app is not yet notarized with Apple, macOS will block it on first launch. To bypass this:

1. **Right-click** (or Control-click) the app and choose **Open**, then click **Open** in the dialog.

If that doesn't work, run this in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr AwalTerminal.app
```

Then open the app normally.

### Build from Source

Requires Rust and Swift toolchains on macOS.

```bash
# Install just (task runner)
brew install just

# Build and run
just run

# Build release .app bundle
just bundle

# Create a new release
scripts/release.sh v0.15.0
```
